    </p>    <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This bacon-studded "cheese corn" is a popular bar snack in Korea,
                 made of pure bacon-y, creamy, cheesy, corny decadence.</p><p>The original
                  recipe uses a combination of mayonnaise and sweetened condensed milk,
                 but we're going with heavy cream here for a lighter approach. This may 
                 be the first time in my career that I've "lightened up" a recipe by
                 adding a cup of heavy cream. Garnished with green 
                 onions, this would be amazing with a cold beer!</p>
